Strings
    Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
    'hello' is the same as "hello".
    You can display a string literal with the print() function:

Example Get your own Python Server
 print("Hello")
 print('Hello')


Quotes Inside Quotes
    You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string:

Example
    print("It's alright")
    print("He is called 'Johnny'")
    print('He is called "Johnny"') 


Assign String to a Variable
    Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:
    Example
    a = "Hello"
    print(a)
