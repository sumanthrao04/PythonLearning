# Python Indentation
# Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
# Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
# Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

#Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
#Example of Multiline Comments

print("Hello, World!")
print("This is a simple Python script.")
